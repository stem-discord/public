Welcome to the first-ever STEM server poem competition. You will be competing against one another, creating poems you think the server will love. Unleash your inner creativity, your inner Shakespeare, your inner writer, or submit just for fun for a chance to receive the @events winner role! 

__Theme:__ The theme for our first poem competition will remain open-ended. That being said, you have the freedom to write about anything your heart desires in a format that suits your topic best. For reference, some popular poem forms include limerick, acrostic, couplet, Shakespearian sonnet, haiku, and villanelle.  

__Additional Requirements:__ We recommend participants to aim for a maximum of 150 words in length. The total amount of lines are adjustable to meet your chosen poem structure, so long as your piece remains within 150 words.   

__Submission method:__ During the period of the competition, you will be able to turn in any submissions via a google forms link similar to how it was done during the christmas tree event. These poems will be first screened by staff before being allowed to enter the competition.

> Note: you may only submit one poem in total

__Judging method:__ Following the screening process once the submission time is over, the poems will be published and displayed anonymously in the #poem-competition channel. All interested server members will be pinged and notified once the voting period commences via the #announcements channel. The method of voting will be made clear once the submission time is over. The winners will be decided based upon the most popular vote. Make sure you pick your favourite piece!

__Rules and Guidelines:__ 
- Only 1 submission per individual is allowed. If you submit more than once, only the last submission will be considered. 
- NFSW content is strictly prohibited and it is preferred that you avoid making any inflammatory submissions.
- Any pieces of poetry submitted after the deadline or through other means than stem.help/poems will not be considered.
- No plagiarism is allowed. Only original content will be considered in the voting process.
- Vote fraud (voting for yourself or someone else using an alternate account) is prohibited and will result in elimination from the competition.

__Prize__:

First place: $20

Second place: $15

Third place: $10

The above people will get Events Winner

If there is a tie, the staff will cast an arbitrary vote based on a random number generator.

Additional random person to get prize: $5

> The random person is selected out of all participants who are not First, Second, and Third place and are not disqualified. A random number generator will be used.
