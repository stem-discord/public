# Want some help with homework or other STEM-related problems? Follow this [`#how-to-ask`](https://discord.com/channels/493173110799859713/625027300920000542) guide.

## How to ask questions:

1. **Pick the right channel**. Please try to post in the correct channel. If you're unsure which channel to use, **post in the channel you think is most appropriate** and people from the server will direct you to the right channel if needed. **Don't post your STEM questions to [`#stem-general`](https://discord.com/channels/493173110799859713/687238115114614906)**. This channel is for casual STEM discussions.

**Post your question in the correct channel** from the above categories.
------
2. **Describe your problem thoroughly**. Don't ask if a person can help you ([don't ask to ask](https://dontasktoask.com/)) - instead post a **detailed description of your problem** asking for guidance. If your question is simply "Can someone help me?", it will be ignored most of the time; none of the helpers will pay attention to a **short undetailed description of a problem**. A good, well-formulated question will not leave out any details and assist the helper by giving any previously aquired information or information you, yourself, have worked out.

> You can post a picture of your problem if you want, but make sure it has good lighting and is oriented correctly. If the image contains multiple problems, specify which problem you need help with. See [here](https://sol.gfxile.net/dontask.html) for more guidance.
------
3. **State what you don't understand about the question and which approaches you have already tried**. Our helpers will try their best to help you learn, but to do so we first need to know what you already know and don't know. This helps us identify which areas you need more help on and which areas you are already able to deal with competently. When a helper helps you, please pay attention - **just because they are guiding you through a question does not mean you can ignore them and then copy the answer at the end**.
------
4. **Ping the right role *after*** you post your question. You can ping one of the Helper roles. For example, if you need help with computer science, you can ping the `@Helper > CS` role. Someone will eventually come by and help you. Don't ping anyone else - this includes random online users and `@everyone`.


Roles available for pinging:

`@Helper > Math`
`@Helper > Advanced/Uni Math`
`@Helper > Physics`
`@Helper > Chemistry`
`@Helper > Biology`
`@Helper > Coding`
`@Helper > CS`
`@Helper > Engineering`

**Please ping the helper roles in their corresponding channels only**
------
5. **Do not post in multiple channels**, patiently wait for someone to help you, and be respectful when they do: **All STEM helpers are volunteers**. If they're taking time out of their day to help you, the least you can do is be nice to them. When they have finished helping, be sure to drop them a thank - they've gone out of their way just to help you!

**(Do not DM Helpers)**
