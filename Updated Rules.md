## 1.0 General Rules

STEM is an educational server affiliated with discord. Therefore,
users are

expected to abide by the rules set by staff to ensure safety,
well-being, and a

sound educational experience. Failure to comply with these rules can
result in

multiple disciplinary actions; it is up to the staff's discretion to
sanction a user

accordingly. However, one should rest assured that staff members will
not

overstep boundaries; a strict staff code of conduct has been
established to

prevent bias and personal connection to a full extent.

## 1.1 Rule 1

Be respectful to other users and follow the Discord Community
Guidelines. This

means (but isn't limited to):

  - Don't insult or attack others, whether directly or
passive-aggressively.

  - Don't deliberately try to irritate, provoke, or 'rile up others.

  - Respect others' privacy & personal space - don't harass people by
DMing,

pinging, etc., when they've asked you not to, and don't share others'
private info

without their consent.

  - Don't post any content (e.g., emotes, GIFs, videos, audio,
files, etc.) which will

harm or otherwise disrupt others' Discord clients and/or devices.

Etc.

## 1.2 Rule 2

Discriminatory behavior and language (slurs, derogatory attacks,
posting hate

symbols, etc.) are forbidden. This covers (but isn't limited to):
racism, sexism,

ableism, homophobia, transphobia, religious bigotry, and rape
apologia.

## 1.3 Rule 3

Be mindful of ongoing conversations. Don't derail an existing
discussion in a

channel or unnecessarily spam messages (outside of #spam).

## 1.4 Rule 4

Regarding age-restricted content (as per Discord's Code of Conduct

http://bit.ly/30M6YxM, aka CoC):

All non-academic, overt, or excessive mentions of sexual acts or
graphic violence

are forbidden. Explicit verbal and visual depictions of sexual acts,
sex organs,

nudity, etc., are not permitted.

## 1.5 Rule 5

Academic misconduct is forbidden. This means (but isn't limited to):

  - Don't discuss any content from official exams

  - Don't ask people to give you complete topics for assignments or to
help you

write them (asking for help developing an existing idea is okay).

Etc.

## 1.6 Rule 6

Don't ping the staff team (@Staff) unless something urgent happens
that

requires an immediate response from all online staff (e.g., multiple
trolls, a

server raid, etc.). You can contact the staff team for less urgent
issues by DMing

@Nemesis or any staff member.

## 1.7 Rule 7

Backseat moderating (vigilante rule enforcement beyond simply quoting
the

rules) is forbidden. If you think someone misbehaves, report it to the
staff team

by DMing Nemesis and letting staff members handle the matter directly.

(Note: If you have a complaint about handling an issue by staff, DM
any of the

admins, aka the staff members, in the sidebar with red usernames.
Suppose you

have a complaint about an admin/admins, DM the server owner, @weqsa.
The

staff code of conduct binds these users. Therefore, they cannot reveal
any

information beyond the scope of their role (e.g., admins cannot reveal
a report

made on a moderator to any moderator).)

## 1.8 Rule 8

As much as possible, stay on topic in your channel. Other than brief
tangents,

when a conversation's topic changes to something more appropriate for
another

channel, please move to that channel.

## 1.9 Rule 9

Don't self-promote servers, petitions, websites, etc., unless what
you're

promoting is relevant to a conversation and is free to use. The staff
has the

discretion to delete any self-promotion that's obnoxious, spammy,
breaks the

rules, endangers members' privacy here, or is otherwise harmful to
the server

community.

## 1.10 Rule 10

Your display name (the name that shows up when you type in chat):

  - Must be partially typeable using a typical English keyboard so
that you can be

pinged in chat (e.g., ùìôùì∏ùì±ùì∑ùì¢ùì∂ùì≤ùìΩùì± wouldn't be okay, but JohnSmith or
Johnùì¢ùì∂ùì≤ùìΩùì±

would be).

  - It Can't be 'everyone,' 'here,' or the exact name of any role on
this server (e.g.,

'Staff,' 'Admin,' 'Events,' etc.)

  - You Must not trigger a bot response when you are mentioned.

You can change your display name (without changing your Discord
username)

by setting a nickname on this server.

## 1.11 Rule 11

Follow all channel-specific guidelines outlined in a channel's pinned
messages.

Not all channels may have channel-specific policies, but the staff
team may set

such procedures whenever & wherever necessary to best maintain the

spirit/purpose of a channel.

## 1.12 Rule 12

Piracy is strictly forbidden, as per the Discord Community Guidelines.
Don't

share or ask for any pirated resources or materials (such as
textbooks, past

exam papers, paywalled journal articles, etc.) or directly reference
where one

may find them illegally. This includes encouraging others to do so in
DMs.

## 1.13 Rule 13

As much as possible, use English for all conversations.

## 2.0 Server Specifics

## 2.1 Acknowledgments from members

By joining this server, you acknowledge that you understand and agree
to follow

all the above rules. The staff team will enforce these rules
throughout all text

and voice channels of the server as follows:

‚Ä¢ 1st offenses ‚Üí Warning from a staff member (unless the offense is
particularly

severe, e.g., academic dishonesty)

‚Ä¢ Further offenses (or severe 1st offenses) ‚Üí Kicks, mutes, or bans

‚Ä¢ The more severe your offense/, the more history you have of breaking
the

rules, and the harsher your punishment (final decisions on punishments
are at

staff discretion)

NOTE: Even for further offenses, you may initially receive a verbal
warning from

a staff member to immediately let you know what you did was
unacceptable

while the staff team discusses appropriate further punishment.

## 2.2 General Description of Nemesis

Nemesis is a private bot created by user weqsa#1134 and has been

collaboratively developed by users Remceau#0001, nop#2745, and
retro#8664

since November 2020. It is currently utilized by a STEM server and an

unaffiliated English learning server.

You can find a complete description of Nemesis in the following pdf.

## 3.0 Staff Code of Conduct

This section is dedicated to all staff members in the 'STEM Helpers &
Students

(SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING & MATH)' server. Server members,
feel

free to read this section if you aspire to become a moderator someday.

Hi! I go by the ALIAS of Sniperzzz, and I will be writing this section. If
you are

reading this, you are probably a part of the staff team. I would like
to start by

wishing you congratulations! You made it, and we are proud to have you
on the team! Now let's get to it. 

## 3.1 Acknowledgments from staff

By joining the staff team, you acknowledge that you understand and
agree to

follow all the above codes of conduct (including all sections).
Failure to abide by

this code will result in removal from the staff team. Here is a
summary of the

key takeaways for staff members:

‚Ä¢ Leaking information to server members & other staff members who are
not

allowed access to specific information is strictly prohibited

‚Ä¢ Acting alone upon a decision that involves all staff members is
strictly

prohibited

‚Ä¢ Respecting server members despite personal opinions is required

‚Ä¢ General server rules still *apply to you*. You are not entitled to
anything; STEM

members should look upon you as role models, so act accordingly

NOTE: Staff members should *never* behave in one conjoined group;
being a part

of the staff is not just a privilege but a duty. To exercise such a
duty, staff

members must have a structured, professional role with no possibility
of

exercising additional rights.

## 3.2 Hierarchical Distribution

STEM staff goes by multiple rules listed below in decreasing order of

importance:

‚Ä¢ Root

‚Ä¢ Administrator

‚Ä¢ Moderator

NOTE: Mini-Moderator role serves no purpose other than redundancy, and

should therefore be removed as a role altogether.

*Root roles* are for users who run STEM financially, legally, and
academically

(nemesis). These users are not to be disturbed by moderation
activities, except

if they choose to include themselves within them; therefore, the user
should also

have the roles of Administrator or Moderator. If they so choose, root
users can

overrule any decision made by either administrators or moderators;
however,

the decision must be *unanimous* in overruling (all root users must
agree to the

overruling).

*Administrator roles* are for users who run staff moderation. They are
responsible

for major decisions (e.g., when to lower server security for an event,
how to

respond to a server raid, or relieving moderators from their duties).
These users

also perform the tasks of the moderator role.

*Moderator roles* are for users who execute regular activities within
the server,

and these activities involve warning, muting, kicking, and banning
server

members' infractions. Moderators are the building block of STEM;
without

them, the server would not last long. Moderators must obey commands
set by

administrators; if any discussion is needed, it should be done
respectfully in the

appropriate channel (#mod-admin-discussion). To keep the server
running

smoothly through all timezones, moderators must put their preferred
times for

moderating in the #times channel. This does not mean a moderator must

moderate at these specific times; it is only a benchmark for
administrators to

use as a reference.

These paragraphs overview each role; administrators will provide more

detailed information once a user becomes a part of the staff.

## 3.3 When to warn

The following examples are to be referred to *at all times* to make a
decision regarding a

warning.

These examples are (but aren't limited to):

‚Ä¢ One-off incidents that disrupt server order or may reasonably insult
another user, e.g.,

one-off generic insults.

‚Ä¢ Light spam.

‚Ä¢ Posting in an inappropriate channel.

‚Ä¢ Unapproved advertising.

‚Ä¢ Abusing the report system.

NOTE: Verbal warnings to users *still count as warnings*. Staff does
not have to warn a

user by always using the Nemesis bot.

Staff members should use these examples as a benchmark for future
warnings on the

server.

## 3.4 When to mute

The following examples are to be referred to *at all times* to make a
decision regarding a

mute.

These examples are (but aren't limited to):

‚Ä¢ Deliberate malice towards another user or the server. (e.g
Aggressive and toxic

behaviour towards other users over several messages.)

‚Ä¢ Encouraging suicide or violence.

‚Ä¢ Hate speech and discriminatory insults.

‚Ä¢ Multiple spam messages.

‚Ä¢ Posting questionable content outside of NSFW channels.

‚Ä¢ Ignoring/defying lawful staff instructions.

NOTE: The duration of the mute will always remain the same, that is, 5
days. This

duration allows for users to reflect on their actions so as to not
repeat them.

Staff members should use these examples as a benchmark for future
mutes on the

server.

## 3.5 When to kick

The following examples are to be referred to *at all times* to make a
decision regarding a

kick.

These examples are (but aren't limited to):

‚Ä¢ Underaged discord users

‚Ä¢ Suspection of illegal activity (in any form)

NOTE: By definition, suspection means 'the act or an instance of
feeling something is

wrong without proof or on slight evidence.' When staff members do not
have evidence of

illegal activity, they do not ban the user, rather kick them.

Staff members should use these examples as a benchmark for future
kicks on the server.

## 3.6 When to ban

The following examples are to be referred to *at all times* to make a
decision regarding a

ban.

These examples are (but aren't limited to):

‚Ä¢ Discord ToS/Guidelines violations.

‚Ä¢ A concerted effort to harm one or multiple users or the server as a
whole, especially if

it results in consequences.

‚Ä¢ Underground activities. (e.g. Intense harassment or threatening,
especially with

discriminatory elements.)

‚Ä¢ Posting explicit content.

‚Ä¢ Staging DM spams.

‚Ä¢ Doxxing. Raiding. Hacking. Posting malicious content.
Recruitment/oraganization of

for such activities.

‚Ä¢ Punishment evasion.

Staff members should use these examples as a benchmark for future bans
on the server.

## 3.7 Ex-Guard role and permissions

Ex-Guards are previous STEM staff members who either have been
relieved or resigned

from their duties. These users will only have access to one channel, a
discussion forum

between Ex-Guards and current staff members. We respect our Ex-Guards
and believe

that allowing them a private channel is only fair considering their
acts to serve our

community.

NOTE: Ex-Guards will have more direct contact with current staff
members and, as a

result, have more say in issues and suggestions. We consider this
just. Apart from that,

Ex-Guards will be treated the same as any regular server member.

## 3.8 Ban discussion of a user

Things are not always clear regarding a ban discussion of a user who
has accumulated

several warnings and mutes. This subsection discusses the following
measures that *must*

*be taken* to ban a 'problematic' user in an unbiased, respectful
manner successfully.

*Administrators* will be responsible for a ban discussion; moderators
will not be involved

and will have *no* say in the ban of a problematic user.

The primary focus of the ban discussion is to discuss whether a user
is a threat to the

integrity of STEM. For users accumulating multiple warnings, this can be
very difficult to

assess. Although the warnings/mutes might be minor, the accumulation
of warnings

over a prolonged period can cause issues within STEM. Therefore, a ban
discussion

should *only be discussed* if a user accumulates 15 warnings /10 mutes
or more over one

year. This is a benchmark; some warnings/mutes might be more severe
than others.

However, bypassing this benchmark (creating a ban discussion before 15
warnings/10

mutes of a user) will require a constructed discussion amongst
*administrators* to

determine whether it is imperatively necessary (this will most likely
not happen.)

A ban discussion must take no more than one week. When a ban
discussion occurs and

is in motion, administrators must mute the user subject to the ban
*for the week of the*

*debate.* Administrators will formulate the mute message in the
following manner:

'Dear user,

We currently have opened a forum to discuss your potential ban. The
duration of the

discussion will be no more than one week. Please do not attempt to
direct message *any*

administrator regarding the ban discussion or *leave* the server.
Failure to comply with

these demands will result in an immediate ban without the possibility
of any appeal.

Thank you for your understanding.'

The ban discussion *must* be divided into three sub-sections (in order
of priority):

‚Ä¢ Gathering evidence of misconduct and regrouping any warns/mutes

‚Ä¢ Discussing the evidence

‚Ä¢ Voting on a sanction

NOTE: STEM applies a 'leniency towards members' policy. Therefore, in
the case

of a tied vote, the user will not be banned.

The most important aspect that demands further explanation is section
2:

'Discussing Evidence.' This discussion will require each administrator
to submit

a paragraph (no more, no less) on their stance on a ban and why they
support it.

A personal relationship with the user subject to a ban is to be left
aside; the

administrators must only refer to evidence to justify their stance.

Once the vote has been taken and *all active administrators* have
voted, the user

will either be banned or remain on the server. The ban message should
be

structured as follows:

'Dear user,

We regret to inform you that you have been banned from this server.
Here is

why: *reason.*

If you so choose, we will allow you to appeal the decision in 1
month.'

The 'remaining in server' message should be structured as follows:

'Dear user,

We have granted you the right to remain on the server. However, we
suggest you

be cautious of future actions.'

NOTE: If a discussion is not completed in 1 week, the user will have
the option

to leave the server or participate in the server, with no mention of
their further

infractions in the current ban discussion.

## 3.9 Reports

If a user so chooses to make a report on a staff member, the user must
do the following:

*Report a moderator:* contact an administrator

*Report an administrator:* contact a root member

*Report a root member:* contact the server leader, user weqsa#1134

Members might be hesitant to report a staff member, but they should be
reminded that

staff members abide by the staff code of conduct. Therefore, if a
member decides to

notify a staff member of an infraction made by a staff user, this
staff member is *only*

allowed to discuss the report with the users who share the staff
member's role or are

above in the hierarchy. For example, suppose a member decides to
report a moderator

to an administrator. In that case, the administrator must only discuss
the report with the

administrators or root members and eventually settle on a sanction.
Failure to comply

with this rule will result in immediate removal from the staff team:
we want our

members to feel safe when filing a report, and we will not tolerate
unfair treatment.

## 4.0 Appeal Process

This section describes the process of appealing infractions made by
the staff stem. You

are entitled to your rights; we will *always* allow you to appeal a
decision *no more than*

*once*.

The appeal process is conducted through a form. Simply type !form in
the bot's private

message to appeal a decision. You will be forwarded a form you must
fill out to appeal.

The form will ask you to fill out the following information:

‚Ä¢ Your discord username

‚Ä¢ The severity of the infraction (warn, mute, kick, or ban)

‚Ä¢ Your appeal (no more than 300 words)

The staff team will review your application in no more than 1 week. If
your appeal is

granted, but your infraction lasts less than a week, the infraction
will be removed from

the Nemesis bot, and staff will not consider the infraction in their
judgment for future

cases.

NOTE: Be aware that the more appeals you make, the less lenient staff
members will be

on accepting an appeal. Do not waste an appeal uselessly.

If the staff members have any further questions regarding the appeal
process you

initiated, expect to either received a direct message from the server
bot Nemesis or an

administrator.

## 5.0 Server Suggestions

This section is dedicated to discuss some of the server suggestions
many have

wanted to make for a long while, but that haven't been initiated.
Hopefully, this

PR will help shed some light on the suggestions.

## 5.1 Removing Valued Role

The valued role has no usefulness other than creating an unnecessary
hierarchy.

If the role is removed, every server member will be treated as equals;
members

need to understand that there is no favoritism in education, and that
everyone is

included and accepted the way they are, with no setbacks for joining a
server

later than others. Furthermore, there is already a 'regular' role
which is given to

active members of the server; perhaps this should be the only role
given.

Although the removal of the valued role will have some short term
problems

--complaints from valued members, potential departures of active
members--the

long term benefits far outweigh them. There will be a sense of fair
treatment

between members of the server; there will be no more issues when we
remove

the role from someone who has committed an infraction; there will be
removal

of certain aspects of toxicity: some members may feel less than due to
not

having the role, and likewise, other members acting entitled once they
have the

role.

## 5.2 Opting out of the performance command

Whilst it is nice to see your own statistics and boast about your
performance on

the server, the ID Card command has been used constantly to publicly
shame

people for their past mistakes. Therefore, there should be a way for
users to opt

out of the option to show their performance on the ID Card command.

## 5.3 Division of voice chat moderators

This STEM server nears thirty five thousand members, which implies

substantial activity in the voice room. An increasing number of users
now

harass members through voice channels. Unfortunately, moderators are
not

always present in voice rooms, and therefore do not have enough
evidence to

ban some members. Furthermore, when moderators are present, users will

remain speechless, not repeating their actions in order not to get
banned from

the server. Therefore, a secret division of voice chat moderators
should be

initiated. These users will not be granted access to the moderator
role nor to the

permissions: they will only be allowed to kick users from voice
channels and

have a private channel to report users to other moderators. The users
chosen

for this role should be trustworthy and active voice channel users in
order to

maximise the division's efficiency.

## 5.4 Reinstate #mod-logs to members

Although moderator logs were removed to members due to users
considering it

'shameful,' there are many reasons why this channel should be
reinstated to the

public eye. Firstly, it would hold the staff team accountable for
their actions.

Secondly, it would serve as a further punishment for users who decide
to break

rules. This reinstatement should *definitely* be considered.

## 5.5 Nemesis 'Rules' Command

This suggestion goes in accordance with section 1.0, 'General Rules.'
The 'Rules

Command' would allow server members to quote the rules by simply
typing

'Rule #', where # is the rule number users decide to quote.
