>
> expected to abide by the rules set by staff to ensure safety,
> well-being, and a
>
> sound educational experience. Failure to comply with these rules can
> result in
>
> multiple disciplinary actions; it is up to the staff's discretion to
> sanction a user
>
> accordingly. However, one should rest assured that staff members will

>
> prevent bias and personal connection to a full extent.
>
> **1.1 Rule 1**
>
> Be respectful to other users and follow the Discord Community
> Guidelines. This

> Etc.
>
> **1.6 Rule 6**
>
> Don't ping the staff team (\@Staff) unless something urgent happens
> that
>

> **1.7 Rule 7**
>
> Backseat moderating (vigilante rule enforcement beyond simply quoting

>
> channel, please move to that channel.
>
> **1.9 Rule 9**
>
> Don't self-promote servers, petitions, websites, etc., unless what

>
> community.
>
> **1.10 Rule 10**
>
> Your display name (the name that shows up when you type in chat):
>
> a\) Must be partially typeable using a typical English keyboard so
> that you can be
>
> pinged in chat (e.g., 𝓙𝓸𝓱𝓷𝓢𝓶𝓲𝓽𝓱 wouldn't be okay, but JohnSmith or
> John𝓢𝓶𝓲𝓽𝓱
>
> would be).

> b\) It Can't be 'everyone,' 'here,' or the exact name of any role on
> this server (e.g.,
>
> 'Staff,' 'Admin,' 'Events,' etc.)
>
> c\) You Must not trigger a bot response when you are mentioned.
>
> You can change your display name (without changing your Discord
> username)
>
> by setting a nickname on this server.
>
> **1.11 Rule 11**
>
> Follow all channel-specific guidelines outlined in a channel\'s pinned

>
> Not all channels may have channel-specific policies, but the staff
> team may set

> such procedures whenever & wherever necessary to best maintain the
>
> spirit/purpose of a channel.
>
> **1.12 Rule 12**
>
> Piracy is strictly forbidden, as per the Discord Community Guidelines.
> Don\'t
>
> share or ask for any pirated resources or materials (such as

> **1.13 Rule 13**
>
> As much as possible, use English for all conversations.
>
> **2.0 Server Specifics**
>
> **2.1 Acknowledgments from members**
>
> By joining this server, you acknowledge that you understand and agree
> to follow
>
> all the above rules. The staff team will enforce these rules
> throughout all text
>
> and voice channels of the server as follows:
>
> • 1st offenses → Warning from a staff member (unless the offense is
> particularly
>
> severe, e.g., academic dishonesty)
>
> • Further offenses (or severe 1st offenses) → Kicks, mutes, or bans
>
> • The more severe your offense/, the more history you have of breaking
> the
>
> rules, and the harsher your punishment (final decisions on punishments
> are at
>
> staff discretion)
>
> NOTE: Even for further offenses, you may initially receive a verbal
> warning from
>
> a staff member to immediately let you know what you did was
> unacceptable
>
> while the staff team discusses appropriate further punishment.

> Nemesis is a private bot created by user weqsa\#1134 and has been
>
> collaboratively developed by users Remceau\#0001, nop\#2745, and
> retro\#8664
>
> since November 2020. It is currently utilized by a STEM server and an
>
> unaffiliated English learning server.

> **3.0 Staff Code of Conduct**
>
> This section is dedicated to all staff members in the 'STEM Helpers &
> Students
>
> (SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING & MATH)' server. Server members,
> feel
>
> free to read this section if you aspire to become a moderator someday.

>
> **3.1 Acknowledgments from staff**
>
> By joining the staff team, you acknowledge that you understand and
> agree to
>
> follow all the above codes of conduct (including all sections).
> Failure to abide by
>
> this code will result in removal from the staff team. Here is a
> summary of the
>
> key takeaways for staff members:
>
> • Leaking information to server members & other staff members who are
> not
>
> allowed access to specific information is strictly prohibited
>
> • Acting alone upon a decision that involves all staff members is
> strictly
>
> prohibited
>
> • Respecting server members despite personal opinions is required
>
> • General server rules still *apply to you*. You are not entitled to
> anything; STEM
>
> members should look upon you as role models, so act accordingly
>
> NOTE: Staff members should *never* behave in one conjoined group;
> being a part
>
> of the staff is not just a privilege but a duty. To exercise such a
> duty, staff
>
> members must have a structured, professional role with no possibility
> of
>
> exercising additional rights.
>
> **3.2 Hierarchical Distribution**
>
> STEM staff goes by multiple rules listed below in decreasing order of
>
> importance:
>
> • Root
>
> • Administrator
>
> • Moderator
>
> NOTE: Mini-Moderator role serves no purpose other than redundancy, and
>
> should therefore be removed as a role altogether.
>
> *Root roles* are for users who run STEM financially, legally, and
> academically
>
> (nemesis). These users are not to be disturbed by moderation
> activities, except
>
> if they choose to include themselves within them; therefore, the user
> should also
>
> have the roles of Administrator or Moderator. If they so choose, root
> users can
>
> overrule any decision made by either administrators or moderators;
> however,
>
> the decision must be *unanimous* in overruling (all root users must
> agree to the
>
> overruling).
>
> *Administrator roles* are for users who run staff moderation. They are
> responsible
>
> for major decisions (e.g., when to lower server security for an event,
> how to
>
> respond to a server raid, or relieving moderators from their duties).
> These users
>
> also perform the tasks of the moderator role.
>
> *Moderator roles* are for users who execute regular activities within
> the server,
>
> and these activities involve warning, muting, kicking, and banning
> server
>
> members\' infractions. Moderators are the building block of STEM;
> without
>
> them, the server would not last long. Moderators must obey commands
> set by
>
> administrators; if any discussion is needed, it should be done
> respectfully in the
>
> appropriate channel (\#mod-admin-discussion). To keep the server
> running
>
> smoothly through all timezones, moderators must put their preferred
> times for
>
> moderating in the \#times channel. This does not mean a moderator must
>
> moderate at these specific times; it is only a benchmark for
> administrators to
>
> use as a reference.
>
> These paragraphs overview each role; administrators will provide more
>
> detailed information once a user becomes a part of the staff.
>
> **3.3 When to warn**
>
> The following examples are to be referred to *at all times* to make a
> decision regarding a
>
> warning.
>
> These examples are (but aren't limited to):
>
> • One-off incidents that disrupt server order or may reasonably insult
> another user, e.g.,
>
> one-off generic insults.
>
> • Light spam.
>
> • Posting in an inappropriate channel.
>
> • Unapproved advertising.
>
> • Abusing the report system.
>
> NOTE: Verbal warnings to users *still count as warnings*. Staff does
> not have to warn a
>
> user by always using the Nemesis bot.
>
> Staff members should use these examples as a benchmark for future
> warnings on the
>
> server.
>
> **3.4 When to mute**
>
> The following examples are to be referred to *at all times* to make a
> decision regarding a
>
> mute.
>
> These examples are (but aren't limited to):
>
> • Deliberate malice towards another user or the server. (e.g
> Aggressive and toxic
>
> behaviour towards other users over several messages.)
>
> • Encouraging suicide or violence.
>
> • Hate speech and discriminatory insults.
>
> • Multiple spam messages.
>
> • Posting questionable content outside of NSFW channels.
>
> • Ignoring/defying lawful staff instructions.
>
> NOTE: The duration of the mute will always remain the same, that is, 5
> days. This
>
> duration allows for users to reflect on their actions so as to not
> repeat them.
>
> Staff members should use these examples as a benchmark for future
> mutes on the
>
> server.
>
> **3.5 When to kick**
>
> The following examples are to be referred to *at all times* to make a
> decision regarding a
>
> kick.
>
> These examples are (but aren't limited to):
>
> • Underaged discord users
>
> • Suspection of illegal activity (in any form)
>
> NOTE: By definition, suspection means 'the act or an instance of
> feeling something is

wrong without proof or on slight evidence.' When staff members do not
have evidence of

> illegal activity, they do not ban the user, rather kick them.
>
> Staff members should use these examples as a benchmark for future
> kicks on the server.
>
> **3.6 When to ban**
>
> The following examples are to be referred to *at all times* to make a
> decision regarding a
>
> ban.
>
> These examples are (but aren't limited to):
>
> • Discord ToS/Guidelines violations.
>
> • A concerted effort to harm one or multiple users or the server as a
> whole, especially if
>
> it results in consequences.
>
> • Underground activities. (e.g. Intense harassment or threatening,
> especially with
>
> discriminatory elements.)
>
> • Posting explicit content.
>
> • Staging DM spams.
>
> • Doxxing. Raiding. Hacking. Posting malicious content.
> Recruitment/oraganization of
>
> for such activities.
>
> • Punishment evasion.
>
> Staff members should use these examples as a benchmark for future bans
> on the server.
>
> **3.7 Ex-Guard role and permissions**
>
> Ex-Guards are previous STEM staff members who either have been
> relieved or resigned
>
> from their duties. These users will only have access to one channel, a
> discussion forum
>
> between Ex-Guards and current staff members. We respect our Ex-Guards
> and believe
>
> that allowing them a private channel is only fair considering their
> acts to serve our
>
> community.
>
> NOTE: Ex-Guards will have more direct contact with current staff
> members and, as a
>
> result, have more say in issues and suggestions. We consider this
> just. Apart from that,
>
> Ex-Guards will be treated the same as any regular server member.
>
> **3.8 Ban discussion of a user**
>
> Things are not always clear regarding a ban discussion of a user who
> has accumulated

several warnings and mutes. This subsection discusses the following
measures that *must*

> *be taken* to ban a 'problematic' user in an unbiased, respectful
> manner successfully.
>
> *Administrators* will be responsible for a ban discussion; moderators
> will not be involved
>
> and will have *no* say in the ban of a problematic user.
>
> The primary focus of the ban discussion is to discuss whether a user
> is a threat to the

integrity of STEM. For users accumulating multiple warnings, this can be
very difficult to

> assess. Although the warnings/mutes might be minor, the accumulation
> of warnings
>
> over a prolonged period can cause issues within STEM. Therefore, a ban
> discussion
>
> should *only be discussed* if a user accumulates 15 warnings /10 mutes
> or more over one
>
> year. This is a benchmark; some warnings/mutes might be more severe
> than others.
>
> However, bypassing this benchmark (creating a ban discussion before 15
> warnings/10
>
> mutes of a user) will require a constructed discussion amongst
> *administrators* to
>
> determine whether it is imperatively necessary (this will most likely
> not happen.)
>
> A ban discussion must take no more than one week. When a ban
> discussion occurs and
>
> is in motion, administrators must mute the user subject to the ban
> *for the week of the*
>
> *debate.* Administrators will formulate the mute message in the
> following manner:
>
> 'Dear user,
>
> We currently have opened a forum to discuss your potential ban. The
> duration of the
>
> discussion will be no more than one week. Please do not attempt to
> direct message *any*
>
> administrator regarding the ban discussion or *leave* the server.
> Failure to comply with
>
> these demands will result in an immediate ban without the possibility
> of any appeal.
>
> Thank you for your understanding.'
>
> The ban discussion *must* be divided into three sub-sections (in order
> of priority):
>
> • Gathering evidence of misconduct and regrouping any warns/mutes
>
> • Discussing the evidence
>
> • Voting on a sanction
>
> NOTE: STEM applies a 'leniency towards members' policy. Therefore, in
> the case
>
> of a tied vote, the user will not be banned.
>
> The most important aspect that demands further explanation is section
> 2:
>
> 'Discussing Evidence.' This discussion will require each administrator
> to submit
>
> a paragraph (no more, no less) on their stance on a ban and why they
> support it.
>
> A personal relationship with the user subject to a ban is to be left
> aside; the
>
> administrators must only refer to evidence to justify their stance.
>
> Once the vote has been taken and *all active administrators* have
> voted, the user
>
> will either be banned or remain on the server. The ban message should
> be
>
> structured as follows:
>
> 'Dear user,
>
> We regret to inform you that you have been banned from this server.
> Here is
>
> why: *reason.*
>
> If you so choose, we will allow you to appeal the decision in 1
> month.'
>
> The 'remaining in server' message should be structured as follows:
>
> 'Dear user,
>
> We have granted you the right to remain on the server. However, we
> suggest you
>
> be cautious of future actions.'
>
> NOTE: If a discussion is not completed in 1 week, the user will have
> the option
>
> to leave the server or participate in the server, with no mention of
> their further
>
> infractions in the current ban discussion.
>
> **3.9 Reports**
>
> If a user so chooses to make a report on a staff member, the user must
> do the following:
>
> *Report a moderator:* contact an administrator
>
> *Report an administrator:* contact a root member
>
> *Report a root member:* contact the server leader, user weqsa\#1134
>
> Members might be hesitant to report a staff member, but they should be
> reminded that
>
> staff members abide by the staff code of conduct. Therefore, if a
> member decides to
>
> notify a staff member of an infraction made by a staff user, this
> staff member is *only*
>
> allowed to discuss the report with the users who share the staff
> member\'s role or are
>
> above in the hierarchy. For example, suppose a member decides to
> report a moderator

to an administrator. In that case, the administrator must only discuss
the report with the

> administrators or root members and eventually settle on a sanction.
> Failure to comply
>
> with this rule will result in immediate removal from the staff team:
> we want our
>
> members to feel safe when filing a report, and we will not tolerate
> unfair treatment.
>
> **4.0 Appeal Process**
>
> This section describes the process of appealing infractions made by
> the staff stem. You
>
> are entitled to your rights; we will *always* allow you to appeal a
> decision *no more than*
>
> *once*.
>
> The appeal process is conducted through a form. Simply type !form in
> the bot's private
>
> message to appeal a decision. You will be forwarded a form you must
> fill out to appeal.
>
> The form will ask you to fill out the following information:
>
> • Your discord username
>
> • The severity of the infraction (warn, mute, kick, or ban)
>
> • Your appeal (no more than 300 words)
>
> The staff team will review your application in no more than 1 week. If
> your appeal is
>
> granted, but your infraction lasts less than a week, the infraction
> will be removed from
>
> the Nemesis bot, and staff will not consider the infraction in their
> judgment for future
>
> cases.
>
> NOTE: Be aware that the more appeals you make, the less lenient staff
> members will be
>
> on accepting an appeal. Do not waste an appeal uselessly.
>
> If the staff members have any further questions regarding the appeal
> process you
>
> initiated, expect to either received a direct message from the server
> bot Nemesis or an
>
> administrator.
>
> **5.0 Server Suggestions**
>
> This section is dedicated to discuss some of the server suggestions
> many have
>
> wanted to make for a long while, but that haven't been initiated.
> Hopefully, this
>
> PR will help shed some light on the suggestions.
>
> **5.1 Removing Valued Role**
>
> The valued role has no usefulness other than creating an unnecessary
> hierarchy.
>
> If the role is removed, every server member will be treated as equals;
> members
>
> need to understand that there is no favoritism in education, and that
> everyone is
>
> included and accepted the way they are, with no setbacks for joining a
> server
>
> later than others. Furthermore, there is already a 'regular' role
> which is given to
>
> active members of the server; perhaps this should be the only role
> given.
>
> Although the removal of the valued role will have some short term
> problems
>
> --complaints from valued members, potential departures of active
> members--the
>
> long term benefits far outweigh them. There will be a sense of fair
> treatment
>
> between members of the server; there will be no more issues when we
> remove
>
> the role from someone who has committed an infraction; there will be
> removal
>
> of certain aspects of toxicity: some members may feel less than due to
> not
>
> having the role, and likewise, other members acting entitled once they
> have the
>
> role.
>
> **5.2 Opting out of the performance command**
>
> Whilst it is nice to see your own statistics and boast about your
> performance on
>
> the server, the ID Card command has been used constantly to publicly
> shame
>
> people for their past mistakes. Therefore, there should be a way for

>
> out of the option to show their performance on the ID Card command.
>
> **5.3 Division of voice chat moderators**
>
> This STEM server nears thirty five thousand members, which implies
>
> substantial activity in the voice room. An increasing number of users
> now
>
> harass members through voice channels. Unfortunately, moderators are
> not
>
> always present in voice rooms, and therefore do not have enough
> evidence to
>
> ban some members. Furthermore, when moderators are present, users will
>
> remain speechless, not repeating their actions in order not to get
> banned from
>
> the server. Therefore, a secret division of voice chat moderators
> should be
>
> initiated. These users will not be granted access to the moderator
> role nor to the
>
> permissions: they will only be allowed to kick users from voice
> channels and
>
> have a private channel to report users to other moderators. The users
> chosen
>
> for this role should be trustworthy and active voice channel users in
> order to
>
> maximise the division's efficiency.
>
> **5.4 Reinstate \#mod-logs to members**
>
> Although moderator logs were removed to members due to users
> considering it
>
> 'shameful,' there are many reasons why this channel should be
> reinstated to the
>
> public eye. Firstly, it would hold the staff team accountable for
> their actions.
>
> Secondly, it would serve as a further punishment for users who decide
> to break
>
> rules. This reinstatement should *definitely* be considered.
>
> **5.5 Nemesis 'Rules' Command**
>
> This suggestion goes in accordance with section 1.0, 'General Rules.'
> The 'Rules
>
> Command' would allow server members to quote the rules by simply
> typing
>
> 'Rule \#', where \# is the rule number users decide to quote.
