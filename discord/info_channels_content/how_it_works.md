## Q: How are the Top Helper Roles distributed?

‚ùØ `@Top Helper Infinity (‚àû)`: Given to the all-time top helper

‚ùØ `@Top Helper Omega (Œ©)`: Given to the weekly top helper

The remaining four are given to members with atleast a weekly thank count of:

‚ùØ `@Top Helper Gamma (Œ≥)`: 4% of the weekly top helper count

‚ùØ `@Top Helper Beta (Œ≤)`: 20% of the weekly top helper count

‚ùØ `@Top Helper Alpha (Œ±)`: 40% of the weekly top helper count

‚ùØ `@Top helper Sigma (œÉ)`: 70% of the weekly top helper count

(Members with `@Top Helper Infinity ‚àû` and `@Top Helper Omega (Œ©)` can change the color of their role with `!hex [hex code]`)

## Q: How do you get a colored role

‚ùØ In order to get a color of your choice, you have to boost the server or win an event!

‚ùØ Once you boost the server, use !color to get a list of colors available to pick from. If a color role is not listed, you may ask an `@Administrator`, `@Moderator` or `@Mini Mod` to make one for you (exceptions to the colors are the colors identical to `@Muted`)

‚ùØ The second way to get a color role is by winning a server wide event. We don't do events too often but if you do catch one and win it, you will be given the `@Event Winner üèÜ` role, which will allow you to use the same command to change your color.

## Q: How do I view thank rankings?

To view your rank you can type `!rank` and to view another members rank you can type `!rank @user/ID`

This command shows all your thank stats, Which includes thank points you earned:
‚ùØ Today
‚ùØ Last 7 days
‚ùØ Last 30 days
‚ùØ Last 365 days.
‚ùØ Your thank points in each subject.

Alongside the thank points, this command will also display your position on the leaderboard for the respective category.

## Q: How do you view your voice rank / stats?

To view your voice stats you can type `!vc` and to view another members voice stats you can type `!vc @user/ID`

This command shows all your voice stats, Which includes your:

‚ùØ Last voice and study voice session
‚ùØ Voice / study voice stats for today
‚ùØ Voice / study voice stats for the last 7 days
‚ùØ All time study voice and voice stats

Alongside the voice stats, this command will also display your position on the leaderboard for the respective category.

## Q: What is study mute and how does it work?

Study mute is a command that will mute you for a self-selected time period. During this time, all channels will be hidden and you will only be able to access #study-chat and study voice channels (with the exception of role channels). This is meant as a way to force oneself to focus on their own work.

‚ùØ **Usage**

`!smute (duration in minutes)` duration can not be longer than 10080 minutes

‚ùØ **Example**

`!smute 600` this will send the user to study-mute for 600 minutes after which they may unmute.

‚ùØ **How to unmute?**

`!sunmute` !sunmute command will not work if the time duration has not ended.

If you want to be study unmuted before the duration specified, you can DM `@Nemesis` a request.

## Q: What is the supporter role and how can I get it?

‚ùØ Boosting the server grants the `@Supporter` role, allowing the booster to change their name color for the duration they boost.

## Q: How do I post my question in the advanced channels?

‚ùØ The `#advanced-<subject>` channels are restricted to members with the `@Advanced <subject>` role. If you want to post a question or help in one of the `advanced-<subject>` channels, ping an active moderator and ask them ***politely*** to give you the `@Advanced <subject>` role, let them know exactly what courses you are taking so they can decide if you're advanced enough to gain access.

‚ùØ Don't post basic questions in these channels.

Note: Misuse of the channels may result in your access being revoked

## Q: What is `@ùïçùñÜùñëùñöùñäùïï` and how do you get Valued?

‚ùØ This role is removed

## Q: Who is moving around the math channels?

‚ùØ The math channels are ordered based on activity, meaning that the lowest activity will be at top. If you are looking for help, use the one which isn't being currently used, which will almost always be found at the top of the category.

## Q: Is there an english/humanities channel? Can I get help in them?

‚ùØ As this is a STEM server and the 'E' in stem doesn't stand for English, we don't have a dedicated channel for Humanities or English. That being said, you may still ask for help on them in #other-subjects.

## Q: What is the `id` command? how is status / behaviour / performance measured?

The amount of stars in performance is determined by your activity in the server.

Each of the following activities consists of 1 star:

‚ùØ ‚≠ê If you have more than 20 all-time thanks.
‚ùØ ‚≠ê If you have more than 20 thanks in last 7 days
‚ùØ ‚≠ê If you have 0 total infractions excluding warns in last 3 months
‚ùØ ‚≠ê If you have more than 4 hours in vc in last 7 days
‚ùØ ‚≠ê If your current streak !daily is more than 20 days

Your status is determined by your account age in this server.

‚ùØ Newer than 60 days: `freshman`
‚ùØ Older than 60 but newer than 90 days: `sophomore`
‚ùØ Older than 90 but newer than 120 days: `junior`
‚ùØ Older than 120 days: `senior`

Your behavior is determined by the amount of your infractions in last 3 months.

‚ùØ `Excellent` = No mutes in the past year
‚ùØ `Great` = No mutes in the last 6 months
‚ùØ `Good` = At most 1 mute in the last 3 months
‚ùØ `Poor` = 2-3 mutes in the last 3 months
‚ùØ `Disappointing` = 4-6 mutes in the last 3 months
‚ùØ `Pathetic` = 7+ mutes in the last 3 months

## Q: How do I use `@Tex`?

‚ùØ `@Tex` is a high quality LaTeX rendering and maths bot. We mainly use it to render beautiful maths in LaTeX or interact with Wolfram Alpha. Check this out for detailed commands for Latex: [LaTeX help](https://www.ntg.nl/doc/biemesderfer/ltxcrib.pdf)

‚ùØ `@Tex` will render anything you put between two dollar signs `${math stuff}$` in latex (example: `This is normal text and $\frac{x}{2}$ was a beautiful fraction in Latex`). 

‚ùØ To get you started, here's a quick overview of the most used syntax:

`\frac{numerator}{denominator}`

`{base}^{things in the exponent}`

`\sqrt{things inside the squre root}`

`\sqrt[n]{things inside the nth root}`

`\text{things you wanna render as plain text rather than as an equation}`

`\ln`, `\log_{base}`

`\sin`, `\cos`, `\tan`

`\alpha`, `\beta`, `\pi`, `\Theta`

`\times`, `\cdot` for multiplication symbol and multiplication dot respectively

`,w` followed by a math query to help to get a response from WolframAlpha (example: `,w integral of x^x^x`)

`,calc` followed by a math expression works like a basic calculator (example: `,calc 25*86`)

‚ùØ There are many people in the server who are really good with LaTeX and the bot in general (there are fun commands too :)), you are always welcome to ask us for help! To end this off on a positive note, you'll learn more by just trying out things yourself, so don't be afraid to let your curiosity flow in [`#commands`](https://discord.com/channels/493173110799859713/691983378089771079) or [`#spam!`](https://discord.com/channels/493173110799859713/753617965823295546)
